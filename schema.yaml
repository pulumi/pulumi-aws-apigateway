  aws-apigateway:index:Target:
    type: object
    properties:
      type:
        "$ref": "#/types/aws-apigateway:index:IntegrationType"
        description: |
          Specifies an API method integration type. The valid value is one of the following:

          * `aws`: for integrating the API method request with an AWS service action, including the Lambda
          function-invoking action. With the Lambda function-invoking action, this is referred to as
          the Lambda custom integration. With any other AWS service action, this is known as AWS
          integration.

          * `aws_proxy`: for integrating the API method request with the Lambda function-invoking action
          with the client request passed through as-is. This integration is also referred to as the
          Lambda proxy integration.

          * `http`: for integrating the API method request with an HTTP endpoint, including a private HTTP
          endpoint within a VPC. This integration is also referred to as the HTTP custom integration.

          * `http_proxy`: for integrating the API method request with an HTTP endpoint, including a private
          HTTP endpoint within a VPC, with the client request passed through as-is. This is also
          referred to as the HTTP proxy integration.

          * `mock`: for integrating the API method request with API Gateway as a "loop-back" endpoint
          without invoking any backend.
      httpMethod:
        type: string
        const: ANY
        description: |
          Specifies the integration's HTTP method type.  Currently, the only supported type is 'ANY'.
      uri:
        type: string
        description: |
          Specifies Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the integration endpoint.

          For HTTP or HTTP_PROXY integrations, the URI must be a fully formed, encoded HTTP(S) URL
          according to the RFC-3986 specification, for either standard integration, where
          connectionType is not VPC_LINK, or private integration, where connectionType is VPC_LINK. For
          a private HTTP integration, the URI is not used for routing.

          For AWS or AWS_PROXY integrations, the URI is of the form
          arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api}. Here,
          {Region} is the API Gateway region (e.g., us-east-1); {service} is the name of the integrated
          AWS service (e.g., s3); and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain supported by certain AWS
          service for fast host-name lookup. action can be used for an AWS service action-based API,
          using an Action={name}&{p1}={v1}&p2={v2}... query string. The ensuing {service_api} refers to
          a supported action {name} plus any required input parameters. Alternatively, path can be used
          for an AWS service path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to an AWS
          service resource, including the region of the integrated AWS service, if applicable. For
          example, for integration with the S3 API of GetObject, the uri can be either
          arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetObject&Bucket={bucket}&Key={key} or
          arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}.
      connectionType:
        "$ref": "#/types/aws-apigateway:index:IntegrationConnectionType"
        description: |
          The type of the network connection to the integration endpoint. The valid value is `INTERNET`
          for connections through the public routable internet or `VPC_LINK` for private connections
          between API Gateway and a network load balancer in a VPC. The default value is `INTERNET`.
      connectionId:
        type: string
        description: |
          The (id) of the VpcLink used for the integration when connectionType=VPC_LINK and undefined,
          otherwise.
      passthroughBehaviour:
        "$ref": "#/types/aws-apigateway:index:IntegrationPassthroughBehavior"
        description: |
          Specifies how the method request body of an unmapped content type will be passed through the
          integration request to the back end without transformation.

          The valid value is one of the following:

          * `WHEN_NO_MATCH`: passes the method request body through the integration request to the back end
          without transformation when the method request content type does not match any content type
          associated with the mapping templates defined in the integration request.

          * `WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES`: passes the method request body through the integration request to the back
          end without transformation when no mapping template is defined in the integration request. If
          a template is defined when this option is selected, the method request of an unmapped
          content-type will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

          * `NEVER`: rejects the method request with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response when
          either the method request content type does not match any content type associated with the
          mapping templates defined in the integration request or no mapping template is defined in the
          integration request.

          Defaults to `WHEN_NO_MATCH` if unspecified.

      The RestAPI component offers a simple interface for creating a fully functional API Gateway REST API. The 
      REST API can define any number of routes, each of which maps a path and HTTP method to one of (1) an event 
      hander route that invokes a Lambda Function (2) a local path route which uploads local files into an S3 bucket 
      and serves them or (3) an integration target such as an HTTP proxy or service integration.
